        <intro>
			Computes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha">Cronbach Alpha</a> for all numerical columns based on their variance. Cronbach's Alpha compares the variance of the individual columns with the variance of the sum of all columns. It typically serves as an estimate of the reliability of a psychometric test. Cronbach Alpha is known as an internal consistency estimate of reliability of test scores since it will generally increase as the intercorrelations among test items increase. The theoretical value of alpha varies from zero to 1. However, depending on the estimation procedure used, estimates of alpha can take on any value less than or equal to 1. 
			If Missing Values are encountered the node will fail.

           <option name="Include">
                This list contains the names of the columns in the input table
                that are included in the Cronbach Value.

            <option name="Filter">
                Use one of these fields to filter either the Include or Exclude

                Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
                list. Single-arrow buttons will move all selected columns.
                Double-arrow buttons will move all columns (filtering is taken into
                account).
