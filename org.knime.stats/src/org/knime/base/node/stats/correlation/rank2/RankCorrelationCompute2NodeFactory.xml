	<name>Rank Correlation</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Computes correlation coefficients for pairs of
		columns, based on the sorting
		of its values only.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				Calculates for each pair of selected columns a correlation
				coefficient, i.e. a measure of the correlation of the two variables.
			</p>
			<p>
				All measures are based on the rank of the cells. Where the rank of a
				cell value refers to its position in a sorted list of all entries.
				All correlation can be calculated on any kind of DataColumn. However
				please note that we use the default ordering of the values. If there
				is no ordering defined in the column, a string representation will
				be used.
				The node uses fractional ranks for equal values.
				<a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient"> Spearman's rank correlation coefficient </a>
				is a statistical measure of the strength of a monotonic relationship
				between paired data. Where the monotonic relationship is
				characterised by a relationship between ordered sets that preserves
				the given order, i.e., either never increases or never decreases as
				its independent variable increases.
				The value of this measure ranges
				from -1 (strong negative correlation) to 1 (strong positive
				correlation). A perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when
				each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.
				For Spearman's rank correlation coefficient the p-value and degrees
				of freedom are computed. The p-value indicates the probability of an
				uncorrelated system producing a correlation at least
				as extreme, if the mean of the correlation is zero and it
				follows a t-distribution with <i>df</i> degrees of freedom.

				<a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodman_and_Kruskal%27s_gamma"> Goodman and Kruskal's gamma</a>
				as well as
				<a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_tau_rank_correlation_coefficient">Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient</a>
				is used to measure the strength of association between two measured
				quantities. Both are based on the number of concordant and
				discordant pairs. Kendall's Tau A and Tau B coefficients can be
				considered as standardized forms of Gamma. The difference between
				Tau A and Tau B is that Tau A statistic does not consider tied
				values, while Tau B makes adjustments for them. By tied observations
				we consider two or more observations having the same value. Both
				Kruskal's gamma and Kendall's Tau A are mostly suitable for square
				tables, whereas Tau B is most appropriately used for rectangular
				tables. The coefficients must be in the range from −1 (100% negative
				association, or perfect inversion) to +1 (100% positive association,
				or perfect agreement). A value of zero indicates the absence of
				association.

			<option name="Correlation Type">
				Chose the type of correlation here. There are the
				Spearman Correlation, two types of Kendalls Tau and Goodman and
				Kruskal's Gamma.

		<tab name="Manual Selection">
			<option name="Include">
				This list contains the names of those columns in
				the input table for which correlation values should be computed.
			</option>

			<option name="Exclude">
				This list contains the names of those columns in

			<option name="Filter">
				Use one of these fields to filter either the
				Include or Exclude list for certain column names or name substrings.
			</option>

			<option name="Buttons">
				Use these buttons to move columns between the
				Include and Exclude list. Single-arrow buttons will move all
				selected columns. Double-arrow buttons will move all columns
				(filtering is taken into account).
			</option>

			<option name="Enforce Exclusion">
				Select this option to enforce the current
				exclusion list to stay the same even if the input table
				specification changes. If some of the excluded columns are not
				available anymore, a warning is displayed. (New columns will
				automatically be added to the inclusion list.)

				Select this option to enforce the current
				inclusion list to stay the same even if the input table

		<tab name="Wildcard/Regex Selection">
			<option name="Pattern">
				Type a search pattern which matches columns to
				move into the Include or Exclude list. Which list is used can be specified.
				You can use either Wildcards ('?' matching any character, '*' matching a
				sequence of any characters) or Regex. You can specify whether your pattern
				should be case sensitive.

			<option name="Include only column pairs with a valid correlation">
				Check this option if only the column pairs where the correlation could

				Select which p-value should be computed for Spearman's rank
