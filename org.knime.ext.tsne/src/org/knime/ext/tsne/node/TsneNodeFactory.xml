		<intro>
			t-SNE is a manifold learning technique, which learns low dimensional
			embeddings for high dimensional data.
			It is most often used for
			visualization purposes because it exploits
			the local relationships
			between datapoints and can
			subsequently capture nonlinear structures in the
			data.
			Unlike other dimension reduction techniques like PCA, a learned
			t-SNE model
			can't be applied to new data.
			The t-SNE algorithm can be
			roughly summarized as two steps:
			<ol>
				<li>Create a probability distribution capturing the relationships
					between points in the high dimensional space
				</li>
				<li>Find a low dimensional space that resembles the probability
					dimension as well as possible
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
			Depending on the size of the input table, the computation of t-SNE can be very expensive both in terms of runtime as well as memory.
			If you experience problems with memory, try to reduce the size of your data by e.g. using the Row Sampling node.
			If you have very high-dimensional data, it is also advisable to first reduce the number of dimensions to around 50 using e.g. a PCA.

		<option name="Columns">
			Select the columns that are included by t-SNE i.e.
			the original features.
			Note that currently only numerical columns are
			supported.
		</option>
		<option name="Dimension(s) to reduce to">
			The number of dimension of the target embedding
			(for visualization typically 2 or 3).
		</option>
		<option name="Iterations">
			The number of learning iterations to be performed. Too
			few iterations might
			result in a bad embedding, while too many
			iterations take a long time
			to train.
		</option>
		<option name="Theta">
			Controls the tradeoff between runtime and accuracy of the Barnes-Hut approximation algorithm for t-SNE.
			Lower values result in a more accurate approximation at the cost of higher runtimes and memory demands.
			A theta of zero results in the originally proposed <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf">t-SNE algorithm</a>.
			However, for most datasets a theta of 0.5 doesn't result in a perceivable loss of quality.
		</option>
		<option name="Perplexity">
			Informally, the perplexity is the number of
			neighbors for each datapoint.
			Small perplexities focus more on local
			structure while larger perplexities take more global relationships
			into account.
			I most cases values in range [5,50] are sufficient.<br/>
			<i>Note:</i> The perplexity must be less than or equal to <i>(Number of rows - 1) / 3</i>.
		</option>
		<option name="Number of threads">
		    Number of threads used for parallel computation.
		    The default is set to the number of cores your computer has and usually doesn't require tuning.
		    Note that no parallelization is used if theta is zero because the exact t-SNE algorithm isn't parallelizable.
		</option>
		<option name="Remove original data columns">
			Check this box if you want to remove the columns
			used to learn the embedding.
		</option>
		<option name="Fail if missing values are encountered">
			If this box is checked, the node fails if it
			encounters a missing value in one of the columns used for learning.
			Otherwise, rows containing missing values in the learning columns
			will be ignored during learning and the corresponding embedding
			consists of missing values.
		</option>
		<option name="Seed">
			Allows you to specify a static seed to enable
			reproducible results.
